                <h1> Nuttida Rungratsameetaweemana</h1>
                <p>Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering</p>
                <p>
                    Nuttida obtained her BA in Neuroscience and Mathematics at Middlebury College in 2014 and her PhD in Neurosciences with a Specialization in Computational Neuroscience from the University of California, San Diego in 2020. During her graduate studies in the labs of John Serences and Larry Squire, she employed a complementary approach of psychophysical paradigms, neuroimaging techniques, and lesion studies to understand how the brain encodes and utilizes probabilistic sensory information for flexible decision-making.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Prior to joining Columbia in 2023, Nuttida was a Swartz Theoretical Neuroscience Fellow in the lab of Terry Sejnowski at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where she explored the computational principles of adaptive learning using biologically-inspired deep learning models. Additionally, she served as a visiting Postdoctoral Scientist in the lab of Ueli Rutishauser at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, investigating the neural correlates of contextual information processing. She was also an Inaugural Provost’s Research Fellow as part of the Inclusive Faculty Pathways Initiative at Columbia University.

                    <br>
                    Outside the lab, Nuttida enjoys cooking her favorite Thai comfort foods and experimenting with new recipes. She also loves drawing and spending time with her little sister.
