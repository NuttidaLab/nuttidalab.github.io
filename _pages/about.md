## Who are we?

Welcome to NuttidaLab, a research lab at Columbia University that focuses on developing experimental and computational frameworks to investigate the neural computations that underlie complex cognitive functions in health and disease.

## What we do?

At NuttidaLab, we are passionate about advancing our understanding of the brain and behavior. Our goal is to uncover the neural mechanisms that support complex cognitive functions, such as learning, decision-making, and social behavior, and to identify how these mechanisms are disrupted in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## Join Us!

We are always looking for talented and motivated individuals to join our team. If you are interested in pursuing a career in neuroscience or related fields and are passionate about advancing our understanding of the brain, please contact us.
