Last Friday, the Columbia BME community came together for a **tropical-themed department retreat** aboard the ***Baylander***. ☀️🌴

It was an afternoon filled with fun, food, and making new memories!

Students, staff, and faculty showed up in their best luau attire, embracing the island vibes. From floral print shirts to leis and sunglasses, the BME crew looked ready to party on the high seas.
