**Herbert Wu lab & Nuttida lab in Central Park for our first joint lab outing!** 

We recently came together with the [Wu Lab of Social Decision-Making](https://www.wulab.bio/) for a fun picnic near Turtle Pond in Central Park.

Members from both labs enjoyed getting to know one another over a delicious spread of food and snacks, complemented by games of frisbee. The outing also provided a wonderful opportunity for informal scientific discussions and bonding outside the labs.

We are excited about our upcoming collaborations and already look forward to more joint outings in the near future.
