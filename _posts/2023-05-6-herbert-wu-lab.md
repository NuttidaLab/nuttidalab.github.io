**Herbert Wu lab from Mount Sinai & Nuttida Lab at Central Park!** 

The ***Wu Lab from Mount Sinai*** and ***Nuttida Lab*** came together for a fun-filled lab outing outing in Central Park on May 6th.

From the Wu Lab, Herbert brought a frisbee which led to some energetic games on the field. He also provided fresh fruits and a salad to keep everyone nourished. Umais, Yuan, and their two guests joined in the festivities as well.

The Nuttida Lab contributed plenty of tasty items. Nuttida supplied sandwiches, while Robert brought the game Codenames and chocolates for some indoor competitive fun. Tomas provided crackers and cheese, and Rudra's fresh fruit platter was a hit(?).

Between frisbee, board games, snacks galore, and great company, the joint lab outing was a resounding success. The two labs mingled, played together, and created new memories. It was a wonderful opportunity for the labs to merge for a day of bonding outside of the lab environment.

After the main event, the Nuttida Lab went to try to catch some turtles üê¢ in action at the park's lakes!

All in all, it was a fantastic day of fun and relaxation for both labs. We look forward to more joint outings in the future! üéâ
