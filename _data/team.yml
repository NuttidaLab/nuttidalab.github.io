    - name: "Robert Kim"
      title: "MD, PhD"
      position: "Affiliated research scientist"
      email: false
      bio: "Robert received his BS in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2012. Following his undergraduate studies, he worked in the lab of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld at Yale University, focusing on mechanisms of impaired consciousness in Childhood Absence Epilepsy. Robert then joined the Medical Scientist Training Program at UC San Diego, where he obtained his PhD in Neuroscience in 2020 and his MD in 2022. During his graduate research in the lab of Dr. Terry Sejnowski, Robert developed computational tools and frameworks to probe neural dynamics and identify neural correlates of working memory. Currently, Robert is a resident physician in Adult Neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center while continuing his research in Nuttida lab and the lab of Dr. Ueli Rutishauser in the Cedars-Sinai Neurosurgery Department. His work focuses on developing computational models and analyzing human electrophysiology data to better understand the neural mechanisms of higher cognitive functions. In his free time, Robert enjoys puppy watching, playing tennis, and watching sports."
