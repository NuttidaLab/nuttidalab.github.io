    - name: "Robert Kim"
      title: "MD, PhD"
      position: "Affiliated Research Scientist"
      email: false
      bio: "Robert received his BS in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 2012. Following his undergraduate studies, he worked in the lab of Hal Blumenfeld at Yale University, focusing on mechanisms of impaired consciousness in Childhood Absence Epilepsy. Robert then joined the Medical Scientist Training Program at UC San Diego, where he obtained his PhD in Neuroscience in 2020 and his MD in 2022. During his graduate research in the lab of Terry Sejnowski, Robert developed computational tools and frameworks to probe neural dynamics and identify neural correlates of working memory. Currently, Robert is a resident physician in Adult Neurology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center while continuing his research in the Nuttida lab and the lab of Ueli Rutishauser in the Cedars-Sinai Neurosurgery Department. His work focuses on developing computational models and analyzing human electrophysiology data to better understand the neural mechanisms of higher cognitive functions. Robert enjoys puppy watching and playing tennis."

    - name: "Tomas G. Aquino"
      title: "PhD"
      position: "Postdoctoral Research Scientist"
      email: "tg2863 [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Tomas received his BSc in Molecular Sciences from the University of São Paulo, Brazil in 2015. Subsequently, he did his PhD with John O'Doherty at Caltech, and was co-advised by Ueli Rutishauser at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. His work focused on single-neuron correlates of value learning and decision-making in the human brain. He obtained his PhD in Computation and Neural Systems in 2022. Currently, Tomas works on the intersection between flexible decision making and recurrent neural network models of perception and decision, leveraging human single neuron recordings. Tomas also enjoys planting tomatoes and playing jazz/bossa nova guitar."

    - name: "Rudramani Singha"
      title: false
      position: "Research Technician"
      email: "rgs2151 [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Rudra received his BEng in Information Technology from the University of Mumbai in 2022. He then pursued an MS in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia, graduating in 2024. Throughout his time at Columbia, Rudra worked closely with Nuttida, focusing on developing explainable machine-learning methods to model the dynamics of human perceptual decision-making. His research interests span representational similarity analysis, Bayesian inference, and dimensionality reduction techniques. After graduating, Rudra joined the Nuttida lab and continued his work on unraveling the neural mechanisms underlying higher cognitive functions through computational modeling and analysis of human electrophysiological data. Beyond academia, he loves to discuss startups, movies, and Dota2."

    - name: "Zelin Yu"
      title: false
      position: "PhD Student in Electrical Engineering"
      email: "zy2489 [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Zelin received her BS in Electronic Information Engineering from Wuhan University in 2021. Following that, she received her MS in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University in 2022. Previous to joining the Nuttida lab, Zelin worked in the lab of Jennifer Gelinas and Dion Khodagholy, focusing on identifying electrophysiological markers of epileptic network progression and memory impairment as a comorbidity. Currently, Zelin is excited to investigate how the human cortex simultaneously handles multiple complex computations at the single-neuron level and circuit levels. Besides academics, she enjoys running in Central Park and playing video games."

    - name: "Siddhant Iyer"
      title: false
      position: "PhD Student in Neurobiology & Behavior"
      email: "si2442 [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Sid obtained his BA in Brain & Cognitive Sciences from University of Rochester, working with David Dodell-Feder to decode ‘theory of mind’ processes from fMRI data. He then teched for Meghan Meyer, relating individual differences in social memory processing to fMRI functional connectivity. At the Nuttida lab, he seeks to understand why real and artificial neural networks change with cognitive context. Outside of the lab, he enjoys playing racket sports and board games."

    - name: "Salma Elhassa"
      title: false
      position: "MS/PhD Student in Biomedical Engineering"
      email: "salma.elhassa [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Salma received her BS in Biology Bioinformatics from CUNY Hunter College in 2022. During her undergraduate studies, she worked in the lab of Eric Nestler at Icahn School of Medicine Mount Sinai. Salma then took part in the NIH Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program as a research scholar at Baylor College of Medicine in Kelly Bijanki’s lab and in collaboration with Sameer Sheth, where she studied the change in depression symptom severity of inpatient deep brain stimulation treatment. Currently, Salma is interested in exploring the neural mechanisms of perceptual and cognitive flexibility. Her project leverages single-neuron recordings in humans with methods from statistics and computational neuroscience. Outside the lab she enjoys reading, writing creative pieces, and exploring places in her hometown in Queens."

    - name: "Daria Kussovska"
      title: false
      position: "MS Student in Biomedical Engineering"
      email: "dnk2118 [at] columbia.edu"
      bio: "Daria completed her BS in Neuroscience at King’s College London in 2023. During her undergraduate studies, she focused on investigating the neural correlates of aggression in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), exploring the effects of Neuroligin-3 mutations in mice and analyzing fMRI data. At Nuttida lab, Daria is excited about uncovering the neural codes that drive efficient encoding and maintenance of short- and long-term memory. She aims to develop a comprehensive, data-driven theory integrating neural geometry and manifold concepts to deepen our understanding of memory dynamics, with potential implications for various disorders. Outside the lab, she has a passion for high-adrenaline sports like skydiving and skiing."
